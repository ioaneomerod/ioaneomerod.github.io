## Coding Standards And Their Effects 
Although some people don’t seem to like coding standards and think of them as tedious, I happen to enjoy coding standards. They give a sense of uniformity to code that makes collaboration seamless. Coding standards also  make code more readable, which makes code easier to debug both for yourself and others. All in all coding standards make writing code more efficient and easier.  

## How Coding Standards Can Affect Your Own Code. 
I remember when I took ICS 111 and learned how to code for the first time, I made some programs to help me with my math homework for fun. However, since I was new to coding I didn’t get why coding standards were necessary in class, and I made all of my projects without any coding standards. When I looked back at those side projects later it took a few minutes to figure out what I coded and what my program was doing. This is when I first realized the importance of coding standards and it has helped me become a more efficient programmer. 

## What I think of Coding Standards?
When I first began coding I didn’t understand the importance of coding standards and how they affected the efficiency of code. I failed to see how indenting code, adding spaces and putting code onto a newline could drastically affect how code operated. However, coding standards are now in my opinion one of the best ways to make coding better for yourself and your fellow programmers.
