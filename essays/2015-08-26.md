I was a mechanical engineering major before I was a computer science major. The idea of being able to apply math and science to create things really intrigued me. After I decided to leave mechanical engineering, the thing that drew me to computer science and keeps me here is that same interest in being able to create things.

All of my interests and future aspirations with computer science stem from my want to create things. I am honestly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence because I feel like it would be kind of cool to make those kinds of programs. Therefore, the biggest skill I’m hoping to develop through my degree is learning how to translate what I want to do into an actual program.

At minimum, I see my future in computer science being a nice data science, software engineering or web development job that I like to go to and I get paid a decent amount to provide for my family. However, what I’m hoping my future in computer science turns out to be is going to a job I like and doing work that I see as beneficial to other people, while pursuing a graduate degree in my field and somehow using my degree to benefit my fellow kānaka and the people of Hawaiʻi.
