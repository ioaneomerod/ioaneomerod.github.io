I was a mechanical engineering major before I was a computer science major. The idea of being able to apply math and science to create things really intrigued me. After I decided to leave mechanical engineering, I was unsure about what degree I wanted to pursue, and I honestly felt a little lost. I was talking to a friend about this dilemma, and it was during this conversation that he mentioned all of the fun programs he got to make in his ICS classes. Hearing about all of this, I thought why don't I switch to Computer Science too? I can make that just like I wanted to do in mechanical engineering. I can make cool programs, code robots, and hack stuff, and besides I don't know what else I'm going to do anyway. So why not?

All of my interests and future aspirations with computer science stem from my want to create things. For example, I want to learn about artifical intelligence and machine learning because I feel like it would be fun to make a program that tries to post to social media based on popular influencers or things that are trending at the time. I am also interested in data science, and I have this idea of making a program that will compare the entire drafting history of all 32 NFL franchises and determine how well or not well teams drafted relative to their draft position.

At minimum, I see my future in computer science being a nice data science, software engineering or web development job that I like to go to and I get paid a decent amount to provide for my family. However, what I’m hoping my future in computer science turns out to be is going to a job I like and doing work that I see as beneficial to other people, while pursuing a graduate degree in my field and somehow using my degree to benefit my fellow kānaka and the people of Hawaiʻi.
