Despite what the phrase “there are no stupid questions” may lead you to believe, there are definitely stupid questions. When I say, there are stupid questions, I mean that there are questions that can be so poorly worded that they come off as either lazy or confusing and people don’t like being asked lazy and confusing questions. 

Take for example this question that comes from: 
<a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13946934/create-contain-file-log-coldfusion"> 
create contain file log coldfusion </a>

The original question posed is extremely confusing and seems hastily posted. The person asking the questions just briefly says what they want their code to do, states that an error occurs, posts their code and puts a specific snippet of code to look at for reasons that I couldn’t figure out from reading the question. As shown by another user who responded to his post I was not the only one confused by the question, which led the responder to politely post ways that the person asking the question could do to improve their question, and only giving a superficial answer to the original poster’s actual question.

To see a question that was asked in a clear and “smart” manner take this question from: 
<a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/which-equals-operator-vs-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons/359509#359509"> 
Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons? </a>

The poster gives background information relevant to the question what language is being used, what caused the poster to ask this question, a snippet of example code and then the question asked in a clear and concise way. For his or her efforts the poster was rewarded by asking a question in such a clear manner with multiple equally clear and concise answers. 
The responding person gives an answer to the question and provides references and examples for the original poster.
