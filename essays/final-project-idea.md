## The Problem: 
<p>
  Some UH manoa students carpool to campus, and there is no specific website or service for college students who go to UH Manoa to find carpool opportunities. This makes finding carpooling opportunities to UH Manoa difficult. 
</p>

## The Solution:
<p>
  The UH Carpooling application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their general home location, their preferred arrival and departure times, and musical preferences. This application will allow students to find other students with matching schedules and take advantage of UH Manoaâ€™s commuter passes.
</p>

## Mockup Page Ideas:
<ul>
  <li>Landing page</li>
   <li>User home page</li>
   <li>User profile page</li>
   <li>Scheduled rides</li>
   <li>Create carpool ride</li>
   <li>Admin Page</li>
</ul>

## Beyond the Basics:
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
<ul>
  <li>Optimal profile suggestions to maximize gas mileage</li>
 <li>Rating system to find reliable partners</li>
 <li>Ability to select different ride share groups for different days</li>
</ul>
