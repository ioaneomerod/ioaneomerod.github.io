## So How About That JavaScript 
My first experience with JavaScript came from this class. JavaScript seemed very similar to Java when I first started the function and variable declarations reminded me a lot of Java. Then, the first big difference I noticed from JavaScript and other languages I knew was no type restraints. In JavaScript functions can return and variables can be initialized without noting a type for said function or variable beforehand. This difference seemed both so intuitive (seriously why can’t I just initialize a variable to whatever I want it’s just a name for a piece of data) and wrong because all the other languages I knew didn’t have this feature. 

## Learning From Stress and Failure
Athletic software engineering is extremely stressful; I felt very stressed and anxious while doing the WOD and I forgot strings in JavaScript were immutable and my original solution wasn’t working because of this. However, I felt the practice WODs were useful in getting used to the timed environment and using JavaScript. I think this helped in keeping me calm so I could keep attempting to get the program to work, even though I wasn’t able to complete the WOD in the end. Despite the amount of stress this causes and the fact that this is the first time I’ve outright failed a computer science assignment, it seems to be an effective teaching method as I don’t think I’m going to forget that strings are immutable anytime soon. 

## So What Do I think
So far I’ve liked learning about JavaScript with athletic software engineering. JavaScript seems like a very capable and interesting programming language that provides a lot of flexibility in its code. Athletic software engineering seems like an effective teaching method that can help concepts stick better than traditional teaching. All in all I expect both JavaScript and athletic software engineering to really help me in my
