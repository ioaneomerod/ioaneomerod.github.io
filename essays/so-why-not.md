## Staring at the Past Through My Rear View

I was a mechanical engineering major before I was a computer science major. 
The idea of being able to apply math and science to create things really intrigued me. 
After I decided to leave mechanical engineering, I was unsure about what degree I wanted to pursue, and I honestly felt a little lost. 
I was talking to a friend about this dilemma, and it was during this conversation that he mentioned all of the fun programs he got to make in his ICS classes. 
Hearing about all of this, I thought why don't I switch to computer science too? 
I can make things just like I wanted to do in mechanical engineering. 
I can make cool programs, code robots, and hack stuff, and besides I don't know what else I'm going to do anyway. 
So why not?

## I See My Old Code and Know I Can Top It

All of my interests and future aspirations with computer science stem from my want to create things. 
Therefore, the foremost skill I hope to learn from all of my computer science classes is how to build better code and how to translate my ideas into a working program. 
With software engineering in particular, I hope it helps me learn how to be a better problem solver so I don't have to resort to Google as often. 
Lastly, I know working in a group is very important for anyone in computer science, so I'm hoping to learn how to work as part of a group better because my current communication and group working skills leave a bit to be desired. 

## Look to My Future Because My Past Is All Behind Me 

I see my future in computer science being one of two possibilities. 
A conservative, average 9 to 5 job that I like. 
Or the more ambitious future, where my future in computer science turns out to be going to a job I like and doing work that I see as beneficial to other people, while pursuing a graduate degree in my field and somehow using my degree on side projects either of interest to me or that I see as helping to better the lives of others.
