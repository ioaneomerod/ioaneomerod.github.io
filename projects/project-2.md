summary: A ICS 211 assigment that helped us learn about binary search trees and the different ways to traverse them. We had to create a binary search tree of Contacts and have a function traverse the tree in order.

" A binary search tree was used to sort an object known as Contacts which had three strings a first name, last name and contact number. A comparator was built that returned an integer based on the contactâ€™s last name and an integer comparator was made to compare the integers returned from the contact comparator. These comparators were used so the Contacts class could be sorted using the binary search tree. A in order function  was also created to traverse the binary search tree in order and return a list of all of the contacts through in order traversal. The in order function would call a helper function that would recursively call itself." 

" This assignment combined elements from things we learned before in the class and we just needed to apply it to this assignment. Like using recursion to traverse the binary search tree in order. And taking what we learned about coding with trees and applying that to coding the binary search tree."
