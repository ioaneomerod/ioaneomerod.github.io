summary: To learn about Java Native Interface in my ICS 212 class, I had to split the given assignment into Java and C code and then compile the code using Java Native Interface. 
---

   This homework for ICS 211 took a user inputted integer and printed out a table of x and f(x) values based on a function where the user inputted integer was the ceiling of x. The user interface code was done in Java, while the code to calculate the x and y values was done in C. The main point of the project was to use Java Native Interface to get compile and execute code that is in both Java and C or C++.

   The two hardest parts about this assignment were trying to switch between writing Java and C code and getting everything to compile and execute. Trying to debug and switch between Java and C while coding was a challenge as I had never worked on multiple languages at the same time before but itâ€™s something I found valuable to be able to switch from one language to another. Getting the files to compile together was also the biggest challenge as I was having trouble including a path for the code to run.

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:
